# SpineNet-49S Implementation in Keras

This repository contains the implementation of **SpineNet-49S** using Keras. SpineNet is a scale-permuted backbone model designed for efficient recognition and localization tasks. The model is based on the paper **[SpineNet: Learning Scale-Permuted Backbone for Recognition and Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.05027)** by Mingxing Tan et al.

## About SpineNet

SpineNet introduces a novel architecture for feature pyramids by learning scale-permuted networks. The model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on recognition and localization tasks while being computationally efficient.

The **SpineNet-49S** variant is a compact version of the model, suitable for resource-constrained environments.
